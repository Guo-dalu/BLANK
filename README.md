# Marc - Chinese detective/crime stories/shows

Hey Marc! 

Sorry for the late response about Chinese detective/crime stories/shows. You know, sometimes one just procrastinates.

Well, as far as I know, it seems that the detective stories were quite popular ever since the ancient China. There were 2 famous detectors, who was a government official at the same time, in China history——Bao Zheng(包拯) and Di RenJie(狄仁杰). The former was from Song dynasty and the latter was from Tang dynasty.

I read a book called ‘三侠五义’(***The Tale of Loyal Heroes and Righteous Gallants***
) of which most stories are about Bao Zheng and his coworkers when in middle school. I guess that’s a book rewritten for teenagers because the language were rather simple and clear. And I felt stunned by one single case called ‘狸猫换太子’. In this case, the Prince of the Song Empire was secretly replaced by a wild cat by the villain to make people believe that another lady gave birth to that boy so she could be the queen. And after several years that poor Prince became the emperor, and wanted to find his real mother. Mixed with surprising plots and royal scandals, this story is well-known in China. Everyone LOVES the royal scandal! The book is not an easy one for foreigners to read, I suppose, but here’s a good TV series about Bao Zheng: [*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cppozV5Se0&list=PLPHFQiE-MdaJGkjgNIBIpdNMICQYdMmGx](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cppozV5Se0&list=PLPHFQiE-MdaJGkjgNIBIpdNMICQYdMmGx).*

About Di RenJie, a Dutch guy once wrote a detective book of it. Check here: [*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_van_Gulik*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_van_Gulik). My mom bought a double-language edition of this book for me to learn English once when I was young. Well, the book is ok, maybe that’s more acceptable for you. And XuKe(徐克), a famous Hong Kong director, made a series of movies about Di Renjie like ‘狄仁杰之神都龙王’, ‘狄仁杰之通天帝国’, etc. Here’s a promo: [*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdMQHdJPk9s*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdMQHdJPk9s)

About the modern works, which I read more after grown-up, I have 2 recommendations that you don’t want to miss. The first guy is called ‘那多’, whose work, ‘那多灵异手记系列’ are series of books based on events happened in the real world. But behind that there are some supernatural explanations. These works are half Sci-Fi, half detective, and the atmosphere is so fascinating that one can’t breathe while reading. My husband and I are all love these series! 

And the next writer is 紫金陈, whose most work were remade into TV series and then spread widely in China. I think ‘长夜难明’(the remake is 沉默的真相) and ‘坏小孩’(the remake is 隐秘的角落) are of the most famous ones. You can enjoy the books or the shows as you like. Just pick one.

I was kind of busy these days, and to be honest, I only read like 10% of the Black Echo. I suppose his style is rather like Hemingway's, maybe. Anyway, I’d like to talk to you about it after finished. 

Chatting with you is quite a pleasure. Would you mind giving me your e-mail address or some other contact methods? I can’t log in Tandem on PC webs for some stupid account reason. And I prefer to write in laptop rather than on mobile. Just feel free to say No.

Herzliche Grüsse

Mengge
